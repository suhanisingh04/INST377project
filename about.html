      <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Healthcare Metrics Dashboard</strong> is a user-friendly web application that helps transform complex CMS datasets into simple, interactive charts. Its mission is to make national healthcare performance data more transparent, accessible, and actionable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>CMS Healthcare Dashboard</strong> turns publicly available data from the
        <a href="https://data.cms.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)</a>
        into accessible, visual insights. This tool helps people better understand key healthcare performance metrics
        such as emergency department wait times, vaccination coverage, and sepsis care.
      </p>

      <p>
        These measures arenâ€™t just numbers, they reflect real experiences. A long ED wait can mean delayed care;
        low vaccination rates may signal risks for both staff and patients; and sepsis treatment compliance impacts
        critical survival outcomes. This dashboard educates users on why each of these performance measures matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a patient trying to make informed choices, a provider looking to improve care, or a policymaker
        tracking national trends, this dashboard offers a snapshot of healthcare performance in a way thatâ€™s clear and
        usable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The data supports decision-making across roles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hospital teams can identify areas for quality improvement.</li>
        <li>Patients can gain more transparency into their care systems.</li>
        <li>Public health agencies and researchers can explore broader trends and equity issues.</li>
      </ul>
