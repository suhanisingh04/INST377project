Description

This project is a web-based interactive dashboard that visualizes national healthcare performance metrics using real-time public data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The application focuses on three critical categories: Emergency Department metrics, Healthcare Personnel Vaccination rates, and Sepsis Care outcomes. It allows users to explore healthcare performance trends and submit anonymous comments to provide feedback.

The dashboard is built using HTML, CSS Grid/Flexbox, JavaScript, Chart.js, and Supabase for real-time backend functionality. It also uses the Pixabay API to enhance user experience with dynamic healthcare-related imagery.

Target Browsers

This application is fully responsive and tested to work on the following:

âœ… Google Chrome (desktop & mobile)

âœ… Safari (iOS)

âœ… Firefox

âœ… Microsoft Edge

# Developer Manual

Project Setup

Note: This project fulfills the Node.js backend requirement through Vercel's built-in serverless API routes, which allow us to run server-side JavaScript in a Node environment without setting up a manual Express.js server.

1. Install the Project and Dependencies

You must have Node.js and npm installed.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inst377-healthcare-dashboard.git
cd inst377-healthcare-dashboard

# Install Supabase client dependency
npm install

2. Add Environment Variables

Note: A local .env file was not used during development, as all API keys were securely configured in Vercelâ€™s Environment Variables panel.

SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
PIXABAY_API_KEY=your-pixabay-api-key

Running the Application

You can deploy the app using Vercel or test it locally using any static file server for the frontend.

Deploy on Vercel

Import the GitHub repo to Vercel

Set environment variables under Project > Settings > Environment Variables

Vercel auto-detects and deploys API routes from the /api folder

Local Testing (Frontend only)

npx serve .

Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard nav)

Add user login system for authenticated feedback

Integrate more granular state-level CMS data
